### 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game Implementation:
The code represents a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. It uses a 3x3 2D array (tic) to represent the game board. Players, identified as 'X' and 'O', take turns entering their moves by selecting a position on the board.

### 👥 Player Interaction:

Players are prompted to enter their moves alternately.
User input is validated to ensure it corresponds to a valid position on the board.
If a player attempts to make a move in an already occupied position, an error message is displayed, and the player is prompted to enter a valid move.

### 🚀 Key Functions:

```
gameBase(): Renders the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board, providing a visual representation to the players.

function(): Takes user input for moves, validates the input, updates the board, and switches the player turn. It also handles error messages and recursive calls for invalid input.

check(): Checks for win or draw conditions after each move. It examines rows, columns, and diagonals to determine if a player has won. If no winner is found and the board is filled, it declares a draw.
```

### 📊 Game Logic:

The game loop in the main() function continues until the check() function indicates a win or draw.
Players are prompted to enter their moves, and after each move, the board is displayed.
Once the game concludes, the program declares the winner or announces a draw.

### 👥 Player Information:

The code begins by taking input for the names of the two players.
Player 1 is assigned 'X', and Player 2 is assigned 'O'.

### 🔄 Recursion for Input Handling:

If a player provides an invalid input (e.g., a non-numeric value or a position out of range), an error message is displayed, and the function() is called recursively until valid input is received.

### 🏆 Winner Declaration:

The game loop concludes with a message declaring the winner or announcing a draw.
The winner is determined based on the last move made before the game loop exits.

### 📚 Learning Opportunities:

This project provided an opportunity to practice conditional statements, loops, arrays, and user input handling.
It showcases good coding practices such as modularity, error handling, and a clear game structure.
🤝 Feedback and Collaboration:
As I reflect on this project, I welcome feedback and collaboration opportunities from the coding community. I'm eager to learn, grow, and contribute to future projects.
